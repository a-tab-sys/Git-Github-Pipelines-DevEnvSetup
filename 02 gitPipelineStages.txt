Git pipeline has 4 stages

1. Working Directory (this is where we make changes)
    --- git add --->
2. Staging Area (changes are first ADDED to an intermediate step called the staging areA )
    --- git commit --->
4. Local Repo (from staging area, it is COMMITED to a local repository)
    --- git push --->
    <--- git fetch ---
4. Remote Rep0 (Then you can PUSH it to  remote REPOSITORY)
    Working Directory <-- git checkout--< local repository
